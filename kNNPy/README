This is a python program that performs kNN classification. It will measure
the accuracy of the classifier on a test data set by finding k nearest neighbors
on the training data set.

To run the program with a training data set and test data set, run the following
in the command line

python kNN.py -t <traing_data.arff> -T <test_data.arff>

The program will produce two plots. 
1/ Plot of accuracy of kNN against the number of nearest neighbors k
2/ Plot of accuracy of kNN against the number of features used in calculating
Euclidean distance

In both plots, the horizontal line is the accuracy obtained by J48 algorithm
This accuracy has been recorded by running J48 algorithm on the data sets

$ java weka.classifiers.trees.J48 -t <train_data.arff> -T <test_data.arff>

and record the result in the .txt files (listed in this folder)
To run the python program on all the given data set, use the following 
series of command

$ python kNN.py -t ionosphere_train.arff -T ionosphere_test.arff
$ python kNN.py -t mfeat-fourier_train.arff -T mfeat-fourier_test.arff
$ python kNN.py -t irrelevant_train.arff -T irrelevant_test.arff
$ python kNN.py -t spambase_train.arff -T spambase_test.arff

At the end, the program will reproduce 8 plots

Alternatively, you can run the script runkNN by
$ sh runkNN
