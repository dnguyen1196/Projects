API


Front end
- Now I know that it can return the correct JSON value
- Need for exception handling ("ERROR WITH POST DATA")
- Use backbone VIEW object to render the movie info
-> Use omdb api to generate request 
-> retrieve movie info including plot + poster image


* When the user makes a new request, clear all the current entry on the screen
* Use backbone view/ model
