- Produce the learning curve on the two data sets with and without Laplace
smoothing -> produce 8 graphs in total
- Evaluate the performance as a function of m -> produce 4 plots in total?
It is useful to actually produce only 2 plots
(2 different algorithms on the same data set with varying m)

- Run the plot against m = 0, 0.1, 0.2,.. 0.9 and 1, 2, ..., 10
